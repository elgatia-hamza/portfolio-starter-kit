# Welcome to My Projects

Welcome! Here you'll find a curated collection of projects that reflect my journey as an R&D Software Engineer at Axelor. Each project highlights my commitment to building robust, scalable, and innovative solutions using technologies like Java, React, and React Native.

These projects span a range of domains, from digital transformation and dematerialization to modern web and mobile applications. My focus is always on delivering high-quality results, leading teams, and solving real-world problems through technology.

Feel free to browse through the projects to see detailed case studies, technical insights, and the impact of each solution. If you’re interested in collaboration, have questions, or want to discuss technology, don’t hesitate to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzaelgatia/).

Thank you for exploring my work!
