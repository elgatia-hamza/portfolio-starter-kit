# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello and welcome! I’m **Hamza EL GATIA**, an R&D Software Engineer at Axelor, passionate about building robust, scalable, and innovative solutions. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of leading dematerialization projects and working with a wide range of technologies, including Java, React, and React Native.

My journey in software engineering has been driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems through technology. At Axelor, I’ve honed my skills in full-stack development, project leadership, and digital transformation, always striving to deliver high-quality results and foster collaboration within my teams.

This blog is a space where I’ll share insights, tutorials, and updates from my professional journey. Whether you’re interested in software architecture, best practices in Java and React, or the latest trends in digital transformation, you’ll find valuable content here.
